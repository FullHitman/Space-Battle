- LACK OF COMMITS -

I Set up new GitHub account a month or so back as I didnt realy like using this one. I wanted it to be a bit more professional.

Unfortunately due to some unfortunate ongoings with google and their security team and some suspicious sign in's from russia, the email associated with my github is now inaccessible. So when it came to changing my github password... I couldn't.

So Im back here on the old GitHub account. After Christmas I knew I had to make a conscious effort to use GitHub more often and stop relying on the sole copy of my projects on my hard drive. 

Unfortunately now I have to resort to uploading the finished project with negative commits as this is a totally repo.
